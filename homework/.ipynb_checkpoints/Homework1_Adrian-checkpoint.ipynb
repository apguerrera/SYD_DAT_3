    "Interview with a data scientist who famously built the endorsements engine for skills. He goes on to explain the differences in working with a small company vs building prototypes and production level code with LinkedIn. Insights over how the data science landscape has changed over his career, the need to get up to speed with engineering and learning about the tech stack. He then goes into the growing pains of LinkedIn, the need for communication and his thoughts on the future. \n",
