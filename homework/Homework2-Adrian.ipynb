    "\n",
    "Linear regression is a way to build a relationship between two or more variables using a line of best fit. It is genrally in the form Y=B0+B1.X1+e where Y is the predicted value, B0 is the intercept, X1 is the independant variable and B1 the corresponding slope\n",
    "\n",
    "These coefficients are determined by reducing the residual sum of squares (RSS) which is the sum of the square errors. To determine how well the model is able to predict, the RSS is converted to R-Squared ranging from 0-1 and readily able to determine fit. The closer to 1, the better the model will predict. If you have multiple independant variables, then the calculated p-value for each variable will determine significanc, ranging from 0-1, with the lowest value being the most significant and value exceeding 0.5 not being relevant.  (p<0.05 being statistically signicant) \n",

    "One of the things that stood out for this particular work was the way the visualisation evoked a personalised response from what was being displayed. It confirmed or disproved instantly some of the assumptions i had growing up in Sydney in an interesting way. It was also very insightful when viewing other cities other than my own to get an overview of the cutural mix of the area and how that translates to the culture and overall experience of that city. The visualisation was instantly understandable and clear to read and manipulate to gain further insights. "
