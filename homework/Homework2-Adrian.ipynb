    "* Imagine you are trying to explain to someone what Linear Regression is - but they have no programming/maths experience? How would you explain the overall process, what a p-value means and what R-Squared means?\n",
    "* Write a review of one Small Multiple project of your choice. Include a link, what you thought the purpose of the visualisation was and what you discovered as a result. Is there anything you would add to it or like to see?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Machine Learning\n",
    "* Read chapters 3 and 6 of Introduction to Statistical Learning\n",
    "* Describe 3 ways we can select what features to use in a model\n",
    "* Complete the first 3 exercises from chapter 3 in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Course Project\n",
    "* Draft/Sketch on paper (or wireframe) some data visualisations that would be useful for you to explore your data set\n",

    "\n",
    "Linear regression is a way to build a relationship between two or more variables using a line of best fit. It is genrally in the form Y=B0+B1.X1+e where Y is the predicted value, B0 is the intercept, X1 is the independant variable and B1 the corresponding slope\n",
    "\n",
    "These coefficients are determined by reducing the residual sum of squares (RSS) which is the sum of the square errors. To determine how well the model is able to predict, the RSS is converted to R-Squared ranging from 0-1 and readily able to determine fit. The closer to 1, the better the model will predict. If you have multiple independant variables, then the calculated p-value for each variable will determine significanc, ranging from 0-1, with the lowest value being the most significant and value exceeding 0.5 not being relevant.  (p<0.05 being statistically signicant)  "
